# posthog-reverseproxy
This is a simple template repository that anyone can just fork and deploy on vercel.

This repository contains a vercel.json file that allows people make a posthog reverse proxy by just forking and hosting them on their own vercel hosting and domain. See `./vercel.json` for the correct implementation of the reverse proxy.
